## Introduction

This project will help you understand the execution of arrays and strings. You can find whether a number is a buzz number or not and also help you find whether that number is a prime number or not. Since many people find difficulty is sorting ,this will help them sort numbers using bubble sort and ballon sort.

## working of the project

command line arguments are used. For getting the output ./a.outchoice(number-1 or 2 or 3 or 4) should be entered. Any number other than 1,2,3 or 4 are entered,then the you will exit from the program and have to re-run the program. depending on the choice entered that particular category of programs will be shown. on enetering the choice 1,2 or 3 that particular task will be done.Any other choice when enetered,you have to re-enter your choice.
